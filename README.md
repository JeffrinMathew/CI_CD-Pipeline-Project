CI/CD Pipeline using Maven, Java, GitHub, Nexus Repository, Jenkins, and SonarQube
This document outlines the steps for setting up a CI/CD pipeline using Maven, Java, GitHub, Nexus Repository, Jenkins, and SonarQube. This pipeline automates the entire software development process, from building the application to deploying it to production.

Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on the system
Maven installed on the system
Git installed on the system
A GitHub account with repository access
A Nexus Repository Manager instance
A Jenkins server
A SonarQube server
Steps
1. Set up the Maven Project
Create a new Maven project in your favorite IDE, or use the command line to create a new project using the Maven archetype.

2. Configure the Maven Project
Update the pom.xml file to include the required dependencies and plugins for the project, such as the JUnit testing framework, the Spring Framework, and the SonarQube plugin.

3. Push the Project to GitHub
Create a new repository on GitHub and push the project to the repository. This will allow Jenkins to automatically pull the latest version of the code and build it.

4. Set up the Nexus Repository Manager
Create a new repository in the Nexus Repository Manager to store the built artifacts. This repository will be used to store the JAR files, WAR files, and other artifacts that are built during the pipeline.

5. Set up Jenkins
Install and configure Jenkins on a server, and install the required plugins for the pipeline, such as the Git plugin, the Maven plugin, and the SonarQube plugin.

6. Create a Jenkins Pipeline
Create a new Jenkins pipeline and define the stages for the pipeline. The stages should include building the application, running the tests, deploying the artifacts to the Nexus Repository Manager, and running a SonarQube analysis.

7. Configure the Jenkins Pipeline
Configure the Jenkins pipeline by adding the necessary parameters and settings, such as the GitHub repository URL, the Nexus Repository Manager URL, and the SonarQube server URL.

8. Run the Jenkins Pipeline
Run the Jenkins pipeline and verify that the pipeline completes successfully. If any errors occur during the pipeline, investigate the cause and make the necessary adjustments to the configuration.

Conclusion
By following these steps, you can set up a complete CI/CD pipeline using Maven, Java, GitHub, Nexus Repository, Jenkins, and SonarQube. This pipeline will automate the software development process and ensure that the code is of high quality and free from errors.
